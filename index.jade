            h1 Delayed Mirror
            p.
              A delayed mirror is a nice tool for practicing movement. I use it to get near-realtime feedback when
              practicing movements that are impossible or impractical to watch in a mirror.

            p.
              Use this tool to see what your coach sees, and make corrections to your form and technique. Dance drills, gymnastics drills,
              and martial arts drills - any sort of technical practice - can all be improved with this helpful feedback.

          h3 Why a delayed mirror?

          p.
            A common criticism of novice weight lifters is that they only train the muscles that they can see in the mirror.
            The chest, arms, and abs get a lot of attention at the expense of their contrasting muscles, which leads to
            imbalance.  Major important muscle groups get completely neglected in favor of what you can show off in a
            bathroom mirror selfie.

          p.
            The same can be said for many forms of training - whether for strength or technique. A mirror can be a great
            tool, but if overused we end up neglecting important details that are only visible from an outside perspective.
            The great strengths of the immediate feedback of a mirror must always be offset by the tradeoff of how
            fleeting the vision is.

          p.
            The <a href='https://www.iadms.org/?400'>pros and cons of using a mirror for dancing</a> have been studied at
            length. Without being so scientific, I can say in my own experience that <i>a mirror doesn't always show
            me how I look.</i> You might relate to this if you've ever seen a video of yourself in a performance and
            been surprised by they way you move, stand, and hold yourself.

          p.
            A delayed mirror is a tool to help you get fast feedback, from an angle a mirror could never show you.
            A normal mirror's feedback is so instantaneous that we can't be honest in front of it, we subconsciously
            and immediately shape ourselves to it. A simple one second delay breaks the connection, and gives
            us a new perspective - one that is closer to how the rest of the world perceives us.

          h3 Alternatives
          p.
            <i>delayed-mirror.com</i> is a simple tool with modest goals - be free, be easy to use, and help people
            drill better. It relies on some features that are not widely supported in all browsers and on all hardware,
            however, so it's not always the right tool for the job. If you find that you need something better, you 
            probably want a native solution that matches your hardware more specifically.
